## Lump Sum  vs.  Zero Down

We offer two different options in our pricing model. In the lump sum model, clients pay for all deliverables up-front and only pay month-to-month for services they require. The services (hosting, technical support, SEO, etc) are technically optional but they're very reasonably priced and thus extremely popular. In the zero down model, they pay a monthly (or yearly) fee for all deliverables and services.

### Lump Sum

Our lump sum offerings **start at $1,500**. This buys you a fully-custom site with up to 5 pages of content utilizing 3 custom page designs. After your pages are designed, built, and deployed, you would pay $25 / month for hosting, 24/7 technical support, and site maintenance. 

Additional pages of content are $50 each while new page designs are $500 each. A page design is essentially just a layout â€” you might want a grid layout for a "Meet the Staff" page and a more basic single-column layout for an "Our History" page. If you wanted to reuse one of those designs for another page, that additional page would only be $50.

We use **Content Management Systems** whenever a client wants to have the ability to create, update, and delete content themselves. This would be a "dashboard" where you can manage a section of the website yourself. Blogs are a perfect example of this. It's $1,000 for a CMS with one post type. There's also an additional $25 / month to host and maintain the CMS. 

E-commerce storefronts are becoming more popular each year. A custom storefront starts at $3,000 and requires an additional $25 / month hosting/maintenance fee for a Shopify backend integration.  

Our most valuable offering by far is our **support services** package. We offer hosting, 24/7 technical support, and basic content updates for the *very* low price of $25 / month. What we're really selling here is peace of mind. For the price of a Netflix subscription, you can have your own team of web experts in your back pocket whenever you need us.

Here's that breakdown one more time:
#### Pages

- $500 per template design
- $50 per extra page of content

#### Content Management System

- $1,000 to add a CMS (includes one post type)
- $500 per additional post type
- $25/mo hosting fee (required for CMS)

#### E-commerce

- A custom storefront and a Shopify backend
- Starts at $3,000
- Requires additional hosting fees

#### Support services

- $25/month for basic hosting and technical support including google analytics and business profile assistance
- $25/month for unlimited edits
- otherwise, $50/hour, 1 hour minimum
- Extra $25 / month for CMS (blog) hosting
- Extra $25 / month for e-commerce hosting


### Zero-down

For many of our clients, absorbing a huge bill all at once for a website is not an option. So we started offering our services at $0 down and $150 a month (or $1,500 annually):

- 5 page designs
- Unlimited pages
- CMS with up to 3 post types
- Hosting for all services included
- Unlimited edits
- 24/7 Customer support
- Lifetime design updates

At first, it sounds like a lot of money to pay per month for a website. But for many clients, it actually winds up being the same price or cheaper than it would be in the lump sum model. It's also much lower risk for the client. We only require a 12-month minimum contract. So if your new site isn't paying for itself in new business after 1 year, *we're* the ones who will lose money, not you. 

This VIP package includes **unlimited edits** as well as **lifetime design updates**. This means our clients have the option to change anything on their site anytime they want including redesigning the entire site. If after a few years they want a new look and feel, we'll redesign the whole site for them for free.

## Case Study: North Park Covenant Church

We recently redesigned and rebuilt [North Park Covenant Church's website](https://npcovenant.org) from the ground up. They needed 5 custom page designs, about a dozen pages of content, and a CMS so that they could manage parts of the site themselves. They don't have an IT person on staff so unlimited hosting and edits were highly desirable features for them. Here's a breakdown of the initial build:

- 5 custom page designs
- 12 pages of content
- CMS with 2 post types
- Hosting and unlimited edits

After the initial launch of the site, there were some additional pages they wanted to add and some adjustments to the home page that needed to be made. They soon realized how nice it was to have a dedicated web team they could text or call whenever they wanted to make a change to their site. It turns out that clients tend to use the unlimited edits and tech support services when they're available.

Here's a projection of their total costs over 10 years:

| Totals  | Lump sum  | Zero down (paid annually) |
|---|---|---|
| After 1 year  | $5,500  | $1,500  |
| After 3 years  | $7,300  | $4,500  |
| After 5 years  | $9,100  | $7,500  |
| After 10 years  | $13,600  | $15,000  |

Even after 5 years, the zero down method is cheaper for them. Since the data above doesn't include the costs of edits in the lump sum model, It would almost certainly take 10 years for the zero down model to start costing more. But that's 10 years of VIP service with unlimited edits, unlimited hosting services, lifetime design updates, and round-the-clock customer support.
