This is a test.
Last spring, it became apparent that the boiler system that provides heat to our house needed to be repaired. I'm a decently handy guy so my initial reaction was to read up on boilers and find out if I could do the repair myself. Even though it seemed like an easy enough job, I decided to get a quote from a professional. Here's what happened next:

1) I googled "mount prospect boiler repair"
2) I clicked on the first 3 non-sponsored links with good reviews on google
3) I got quotes from each and then I hired one of them

Two things about this experience stood out to me. First, I hired a professional and avoided wasting a weekend trying to fix something I knew nothing about. Second, I used Google to find said professional.

## Play to your strengths

I'm really glad I hired a professional because it turns out that the repair I was going to make myself wouldn't have fixed the issue. Going with a professional on something as complex as a hydronic boiler system was the smart move. The same is true when it comes to the web. 

Websites are surprisingly complicated pieces of technology. A good one will load in mere milliseconds, be accessible to search engines, and be appealing to humans as well. However, most people only think about a site's look and feel when judging it's quality. For this reason, they mistakenly view their site as an expensive brochure. In reality, a good site is more like the cheapest, most effective sales rep you could possibly hire.

Since websites are almost always the first point of contact a potential customer will make with your business, a professional-looking site and a strong google business profile are the two most important ways you can establish your credibility.

A lot of people wince at the idea of spending hundreds of dollars per month on something as banal as a website. After all, platforms like Squarespace make it trivially easy to create your own site and they only charge around $25 / month. WordPress is even cheaper (technically, it's free) if you don't mind doing a little more setup and configuration.

The catch in both cases is that it's on you, the business owner, to design and maintain the site. Notice the last part of that sentence â€” *maintain* the site. The truth is that no one wants to maintain a website, myself included. It's a lot of work. It requires staying up to date on the latest trends in browsers, SEO best practices, and more. Websites that aren't properly maintained decay.
